Version: 1.0.5
Date: 21. 03. 2019
  Features:
    - Added Rifle for Better Cargo Plane and Sniper Rifle for Even Better Cargo Plane.
      These are based on Bob's Warfare, both stats and art
  Changes:
    - Renamed the mod to "Better Cargo Planes" (from "Aircraft - Cargo Plane Equipment Slots") to make it more concise, and better reflect the features of the mod.

Version: 1.0.4
Date: 21. 03. 2019
  Major Features:
    - Added the Better Cargo Plane, and the Even Better Cargo Plane
      This is an early version, so there will be rebalancing.
      These are temporary visuals. They all currently look like the original Cargo Plane
  Features:
    - The recipe for both the Better Cargo Plane, and the Even Better Cargo Plane has been adjusted for playing with Bob's Mods.
      This includes, but not limited to:
      Electrical engine units -> Vehicle Overdrive Motor / Vehicle Overdrive Engine
      Submachine-gun -> Rifle / Sniper-Rifle
  Minor Features:
    - Added descriptions to Afterburner and Vehicle Energy Shield
  Balancing:
    - Increased Mining Time of all Aircraft to 5 seconds. (Up from 1). You will no longer accidentally disassemble your airplane.
      This applies to Cargo Plane, Gunship, Jet, and Flying Fortress, as well as Better Cargo Plane, and Even Better Cargo Plane

Version: 1.0.3
Date: 20. 03. 2019
  Changes:
    - Removed Support for Electric Vehicles: Reborn. Previously this was an optional dependency, but it didn't actually work. 
      I do not understand how it works, as even with 15x Fusion Creator MK6 and 10x High-Voltage Transformers, it still consumes fuel. 
      I might add it back in the future if I find out how it works.
